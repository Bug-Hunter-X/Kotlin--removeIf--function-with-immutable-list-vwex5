This example demonstrates a common error in Kotlin when using the `removeIf` function with immutable lists. The `removeIf` function modifies the list in place, and therefore requires a mutable list. Attempting to use it with an immutable list (`listOf`) results in a compile-time error.  The solution shows how to use `filter` to create a new list containing only the odd numbers, leaving the original list unchanged. This showcases the difference between mutable and immutable collections in Kotlin and how to handle them appropriately.
